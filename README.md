# Agentic Honeypot for Scam Detection & Intelligence Extraction

A professional, backend-focused project that establishes a **secure and extensible foundation** for an agentic AI honeypot system.  
The system is designed to detect scam intent, support multi-turn agentic conversations, and extract structured scam intelligence using modern LLM tooling.

## Project Purpose

Online scams such as phishing, impersonation, and payment fraud are increasingly adaptive, often bypassing traditional detection systems.  
This project provides a **production-ready backend architecture** that can be extended with agentic AI capabilities to engage scammers covertly and extract actionable intelligence.

## Key Objectives

- Provide a secure REST API for message ingestion  
- Support agentic, multi-turn conversational workflows  
- Enable scalable integration of scam detection and intelligence extraction  
- Follow clean, professional software engineering practices  

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **FastAPI** – asynchronous REST API framework
- **Pydantic** – request and response validation
- **LangChain** – LLM orchestration
- **LangGraph** – stateful agentic workflow management
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** – configurable (OpenAI / Groq / Gemini)
- **Git** – version control with conventional commits
- **Virtual Environments (`venv`)** – dependency isolation
